This is a great resource to start with. Over the time of an hour, 3B1B
thoroughly explains the mechanics of how a neural network learns. It assumes
no prior knowledge, and culminates in a mathematical dive into
backpropagation. Only the first 4 videos are strictly relevant.

Building a network from scratch means not using PyTorch or TensorFlow. You
must write your own optimizing function, as well as implement methods like
propagation, initialization, and correction. This video builds perfectly on
top of the 3Blue1Brown series. If you're interested in taking your AI
knowledge to the next level, then this is a very attractive project to do.
